More functional
Prefer expressions over statements

Functional C?

# Types

The usual: i32, f64, etc.
- void is `()`, a zero-byte thing
- blob type for some data

Generic Type Params: Rust Style? -> would be nice to not have to specify

Protocols/Typeclasses

Kinda want types to be arbitrary, i.e. an i32 is not instrinsically a number, it just happens to have a binary operation called addition.
